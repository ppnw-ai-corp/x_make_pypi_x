# x_make_pypi_x — Production Ledger

I capture every significant change to this release foundry here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so each published artefact maps cleanly to its originating code.

## [0.20.4] - 2025-10-15
### Changed
- Publishing guidance updated for the Road to 0.20.4 release so artifact manifests flow into `make_all_summary.json` and the Release Assembly Kanban column without manual patchwork.
- README refreshed to underline the checksum evidence requirements now enforced by the orchestrator summary.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- README and publishing checklist updated for the Road to 0.20.3 JSON evidence requirements.

## [0.20.2] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Updated publishing documentation for the Road to 0.20.2 release, including refreshed example drivers and control-room guidance.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Centralized PyPI availability polling in `publish_flow.wait_for_pypi_release` so the orchestrator simply delegates.
- Refreshed documentation to steer every publisher to the Road to 0.20.1 control-room ledger before shipping a build.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Codified the README to explain how the publisher isolates builds, generates typing artifacts, and drives Twine uploads.
- Logged the changelog scaffold so every future release captures metadata, credentials, and packaging shifts.

### Changed
- None.

### Fixed
- None.
